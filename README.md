# ECE147-Research Project

Our research concerns EEG signal processing for human brain waves using CNN and RNN models for action classification. 
We compare performance of CNNs and RNNs to LSTMs using F1 score as a metric for classifcation quality.

# The Dataset

(EEG Signal)[./Gallery/EEG.png]

# Model Architectures

We propose several model architectures including an vanilla CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM fusion model described more in depth within our paper.

# Future Directions

* We implement EEG signal generation using a GAN architecture and assess artificial EEG generation performance using our existing classification models.
